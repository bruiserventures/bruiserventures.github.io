                    <hr>

<p>Last Updated: April 24, 2015</p>
<p>Welcome, and thank you for your interest in Bruiser Ventures,
LLC. (“BV”, “we,” or “us”) and our Web site at www.bruiser-ventures.com (the
“Site”), as well as all related mobile applications (including tablet
applications), and other services provided by us and on which a link
to these Terms of Service is displayed (collectively, together with
the Site, our “Service”). These Terms of Service are a legally binding
contract between you and BV regarding your use of the Service.</p>

<p>PLEASE READ THE FOLLOWING TERMS OF USE CAREFULLY. BY CLICKING “I
ACCEPT,” YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT YOU HAVE READ, UNDERSTOOD, AND AGREE TO
BE BOUND BY THE FOLLOWING TERMS AND CONDITIONS, INCLUDING THE BV
PRIVACY POLICY (COLLECTIVELY, THESE “TERMS”). If you are not eligible,
or do not agree to these Terms, then please do not use the
Service.</p>

<p>These Terms of Service provide that all disputes between you and BV
will be resolved by binding arbitration. YOU AGREE TO GIVE UP YOUR
RIGHT TO GO TO COURT TO ASSERT OR DEFEND YOUR RIGHTS UNDER THIS
CONTRACT (except for matters that may be taken to small claims
court). YOUR RIGHTS WILL BE DETERMINED BY A NEUTRAL ARBITRATOR AND NOT
A JUDGE OR JURY AND YOUR CLAIMS CANNOT BE BROUGHT AS A CLASS
ACTION. Please review the Arbitration provision in Section 19 below
for the details regarding your agreement to arbitrate any disputes
with BV.<br>  1. BV Service Overview. BV is based on an open-source
software platform that enables data science, advanced analytics, and
machine learning on large datasets.<br>  2. Eligibility. You must be
at least 18 years of age to use the Service. By accepting these terms
or registering for an account for the Service, you represent and
warrant to us: (i) that you are at least 18 years of age; (ii) that
you have not previously been suspended or removed from the Service;
and (iii) that your registration and your use of the Service is in
compliance with any and all applicable laws and regulations. If you
are using the Service on behalf of an entity, organization, or
company, you represent and warrant that you have the authority to bind
that organization to these Terms and you agree to be bound by these
Terms on behalf of that organization.<br>  3. Permission to Use the
Service. Subject to your compliance with these Terms, BV grants to you
a personal, limited, non-exclusive, non-transferable, freely revocable
right and license to access and use the Service and the content made
available via the Service. Certain software made available on or
through the Service may be provided to you under its own licensing
terms.<br>  4. Accounts and Registration. To access most features of
the Service, you must register for an account. When you register for
an account, you may be required to provide us with some information
about yourself (such as your e-mail address or other contact
information). Because we may only permit you to register for an
account for the Service by providing your credentials for certain
third party authentication services (each, an “Authentication
Service”), such as Google or Github, you may also be required to
provide your Google ID, Github ID, or your login credentials for
another Authentication Service. The applicable Authentication Service
may also ask you to provide a password for your account with that
Authentication Service. You agree that the information you provide to
us is accurate and that you will keep it accurate and up-to-date at
all times. By registering for an account for the Service by providing
any account information through an Authentication Service, you agree
that BV may access and use any account information from the
Authentication Service that you have configured to be made available
to third parties in this manner, and you agree to the terms of use of
the Authentication Service regarding your use of the Service via the
Authentication Service. You further agree that any Authentication
Service is a Linked Site (as defined below) and you are solely
responsible for your interactions with the Authentication Service as a
result of accessing the Service through the Authentication
Service. You are solely responsible for maintaining the
confidentiality of your account. You agree to accept responsibility
for all activities that occur under your account. If you have reason
to believe that your account is no longer secure, then you must
immediately notify us at contact@bruiser-ventures.com.<br>
5. Payment. The Service is currently offered to you free of
charge. However, BV reserves the right to charge subscription fees,
now or in the future, for the use of the Service or any part
thereof. You agree to pay to BV all fees for services purchased on or
through the Service under your account at the then-current rates for
those services (including any applicable taxes). For any change in
fees, BV will send you a notice of the change in advance of
commencement (via a message on or through the Service or email).<br>
6. User Content<br> 6.1 User Content Generally. Certain features of
the Service may permit users to upload content, including, without
limitation, data, text, software code, images, and other types of
works (collectively, “User Content”). You retain copyright and any
other proprietary rights that you may hold in the User Content that
you post to the Service.<br>  6.2 Limited License Grant to BV. By
posting or publishing User Content, you grant BV a worldwide,
non-exclusive, fully paid-up, royalty-free, perpetual, sublicensable,
and transferable license to host, store, use, transfer, display,
perform, reproduce, modify, and distribute your User Content and
derivatives thereof, in whole or in part, in any media formats and
through any media channels (now known or hereafter developed), for the
purpose of providing you with the Service and the current and future
services, features and functionality available on or through it, and
for our internal business purposes.<br>  6.3 Limited License Grant to
Other Users. The Service may permit you to share the User Content you
post with other users of the Service. By posting and sharing User
Content with another user of the Service, you hereby grant that user a
non-exclusive license to access and use that User Content as permitted
by these Terms and the functionality of the Service.<br>  6.4 User
Content Representations and Warranties. You are solely responsible for
your User Content and the consequences of posting or publishing User
Content. By posting and publishing User Content, you affirm,
represent, and warrant that:<br> * you are the creator and owner of,
or have the necessary licenses, rights, consents, and permissions to
use and to authorize BV and users of the Service to use and distribute
your User Content as necessary to exercise the licenses granted by you
in this Section 6 and in the manner contemplated by BV and these
Terms; and<br> * your User Content, and the use thereof as
contemplated herein, does not and will not: (i) infringe, violate, or
misappropriate any third-party right, including any copyright,
trademark, patent, trade secret, moral right, privacy right, right of
publicity, or any other intellectual property or proprietary right; or
(ii) slander, defame, libel any third party.<br>  6.5 User Content
Disclaimer. We are under no obligation to edit or control User Content
that you or other users post or publish, and will not be in any way
responsible or liable for User Content. BV may, however, at any time
and without prior notice, screen, remove, edit, or block any User
Content that in our sole judgment violates these Terms or is otherwise
objectionable. You understand that when using the Service you will be
exposed to User Content from a variety of sources and acknowledge that
User Content may be inaccurate, offensive, indecent or
objectionable. You agree to waive, and hereby do waive, any legal or
equitable rights or remedies you have or may have against BV with
respect to User Content. We expressly disclaim any and all liability
in connection with User Content. If notified by a user or content
owner that User Content allegedly does not conform to these Terms, we
may investigate the allegation and determine in our sole discretion
whether to remove the User Content, which we reserve the right to do
at any time and without notice. For clarity, BV does not permit
copyright-infringing activities on the Service.<br>  7. Digital
Millennium Copyright Act<br> 7.1 DMCA Notification. We comply with the
provisions of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act applicable to
internet service providers (17 U.S.C. §512, as amended). If you have
any complaints with respect to material posted on the Service, you may

that the above information in your notice is accurate and that, under
penalty of perjury, you are the copyright or intellectual property
owner or authorized to act on the copyright or intellectual property
owner’s behalf.<br>  7.2 Repeat Infringers. BV will promptly
terminate without notice the accounts of users that are determined by
BV to be “repeat infringers.” A repeat infringer is a user who has
been notified of infringing activity more than twice and/or has had
User Content removed from the Service more than twice.<br>

COMPONENTS, AND DO NOT WARRANT THAT ANY OF THE FOREGOING WILL BE
qCORRECTED.</p>

<p>NO ADVICE OR INFORMATION, WHETHER ORAL OR WRITTEN, OBTAINED BY YOU

SOLELY RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY DAMAGE TO YOUR PROPERTY (INCLUDING YOUR
COMPUTER SYSTEM USED IN CONNECTION WITH THE SERVICE) OR LOSS OF DATA

TO OR USE OF, OR YOUR INABILITY TO ACCESS OR USE, THE SERVICE OR ANY

LIMITATION OF LIABILITY FOR CONSEQUENTIAL OR INCIDENTAL
DAMAGES. ACCORDINGLY, THE ABOVE LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.<br>
EACH PROVISION OF THESE TERMS THAT PROVIDES FOR A LIMITATION OF
LIABILITY, DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTIES, OR EXCLUSION OF DAMAGES IS TO
ALLOCATE THE RISKS UNDER THESE TERMS BETWEEN THE PARTIES. THIS
ALLOCATION IS AN ESSENTIAL ELEMENT OF THE BASIS OF THE BARGAIN BETWEEN

ALL OTHER PROVISIONS OF THESE TERMS. THE LIMITATIONS IN THIS SECTION
15 WILL APPLY EVEN IF ANY LIMITED REMEDY FAILS OF ITS ESSENTIAL
PURPOSE.<br>  18. Governing Law. These Terms shall be governed by the
laws of the State of Tennessee without regard to conflict of law
principles. To the extent that any lawsuit or court proceeding is
permitted hereunder, you and BV agree to submit to the personal and
exclusive jurisdiction of the state courts and federal courts located
within Knox County, Tennessee for the purpose of litigating all
disputes.<br>  19. Dispute Resolution and Arbitration<br> 19.1
Generally. In the interest of resolving disputes between you and BV in
the most expedient and cost effective manner, you and BV agree that
any and all disputes arising in connection with these Terms shall be
resolved by binding arbitration. Arbitration is more informal than a
lawsuit in court. Arbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a
judge or jury, may allow for more limited discovery than in court, and
can be subject to very limited review by courts. Arbitrators can award
the same damages and relief that a court can award. Our agreement to
arbitrate disputes includes, but is not limited to all claims arising
out of or relating to any aspect of these Terms, whether based in
contract, tort, statute, fraud, misrepresentation or any other legal
theory, and regardless of whether the claims arise during or after the
termination of these Terms. YOU UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT, BY ENTERING
INTO THESE TERMS, YOU AND BV ARE EACH WAIVING THE RIGHT TO A TRIAL BY
JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION.<br>  19.2
Exceptions. Notwithstanding subsection 18.1, we both agree that
nothing herein will be deemed to waive, preclude, or otherwise limit
either of our right to (i) bring an individual action in small claims
court, (ii) pursue enforcement actions through applicable federal,
state, or local agencies where such actions are available, (iii) seek
injunctive relief in a court of law, or (iv) to file suit in a court
of law to address intellectual property infringement claims.<br>  19.3
Arbitrator. Any arbitration between you and BV will be governed by the
Commercial Dispute Resolution Procedures and the Supplementary
Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes (collectively, “AAA Rules”)
of the American Arbitration Association (“AAA”), as modified by these
Terms, and will be administered by the AAA. The AAA Rules and filing
forms are available online at www.adr.org, by calling the AAA at
1-800-778-7879, or by contacting BV.<br>  19.4 Notice; Process. A
party who intends to seek arbitration must first send a written notice
of the dispute to the other, by certified mail or Federal Express
(signature required), or in the event that we do not have a physical
address on file for you, by electronic mail (“Notice”). BV’s address
for Notice is: Bruiser Ventures, LLC., PO Box 1036 1237 E WEISGARBER
RD RM 9831 KNOXVILLE, TN 37950-9831. The Notice must (i) describe the
nature and basis of the claim or dispute; and (ii) set forth the
specific relief sought (“Demand”). We agree to use good faith efforts
to resolve the claim directly, but if we do not reach an agreement to
do so within 30 days after the Notice is received, you or BV may
commence an arbitration proceeding. During the arbitration, the amount
of any settlement offer made by you or BV shall not be disclosed to
the arbitrator until after the arbitrator makes a final decision and
award, if any. In the event our dispute is finally resolved through
arbitration in your favor, BV shall pay you (i) the amount awarded by
the arbitrator, if any, (ii) the last written settlement amount
offered by BV in settlement of the dispute prior to the arbitrator’s
award; or (iii) $1,000.00, whichever is greater.<br>  19.5 Fees. In
the event that you commence arbitration in accordance with these
Terms, BV will reimburse you for your payment of the filing fee,
unless your claim is for greater than $10,000, in which case the
payment of any fees shall be decided by the AAA Rules. Any arbitration
hearings will take place at a location to be agreed upon in Knox
County, Tennessee, provided that if the claim is for $10,000 or less,
you may choose whether the arbitration will be conducted (i) solely on
the basis of documents submitted to the arbitrator; (ii) through a
non-appearance based telephonic hearing; or (iii) by an in-person
hearing as established by the AAA Rules in the county (or parish) of
your billing address. If the arbitrator finds that either the
substance of your claim or the relief sought in the Demand is
frivolous or brought for an improper purpose (as measured by the
standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)), then
the payment of all fees will be governed by the AAA Rules. In that
case, you agree to reimburse BV for all monies previously disbursed by
it that are otherwise your obligation to pay under the AAA
Rules. Regardless of the manner in which the arbitration is conducted,
the arbitrator shall issue a reasoned written decision sufficient to
explain the essential findings and conclusions on which the decision
and award, if any, are based. The arbitrator may make rulings and
resolve disputes as to the payment and reimbursement of fees or
expenses at any time during the proceeding and upon request from
either party made within 14 days of the arbitrator’s ruling on the
merits.<br>  19.6 No Class Actions. YOU AND BV AGREE THAT EACH MAY
BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY
AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR
REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. Further, unless both you and BV agree
otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person’s
claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a
representative or class proceeding.<br>  19.7 Modifications. In the
event that BV makes any future change to this arbitration provision
(other than a change to BV’s address for Notice), you may reject that
change by sending us written notice within 30 days of the change to
BV’s address for Notice, in which case your account with BV shall be
immediately terminated and this arbitration provision, as in effect
immediately prior to the amendments you reject shall survive.<br>
19.8 Enforceability. If Subsection 18.6 is found to be unenforceable
or if the entirety of this Section 19 is found to be unenforceable,
then the entirety of this Section 19 shall be null and void and, in
that case, the parties agree that the exclusive jurisdiction and venue
described in Section 18 shall govern any action arising out of or
related to these Terms.<br>  20. Consent to Electronic
Communications. By using the Service, you consent to receiving certain
electronic communications from us as further described in our Privacy
Policy. Please read our Privacy Policy to learn more about your
choices regarding our electronic communications practices. You agree
that any notices, agreements, disclosures, or other communications
that we send to you electronically will satisfy any legal
communication requirements, including that these communications be in
writing.<br>  21. Miscellaneous. These Terms, together with the
Privacy Policy and any other agreements expressly incorporated by
reference herein, constitute the entire and exclusive understanding
and agreement between you and BV regarding your use of and access to
the Service, and except as expressly permitted above may be amended
only by a written agreement signed by authorized representatives of
all parties to these Terms. You may not assign or transfer these Terms
or your rights hereunder, in whole or in part, by operation of law or
otherwise, without our prior written consent. We may assign these
Terms at any time without notice. The failure to require performance
of any provision will not affect our right to require performance at
any time thereafter, nor shall a waiver of any breach or default of
these Terms or any provision of these Terms constitute a waiver of any
subsequent breach or default or a waiver of the provision itself. Use
of section headers in these Terms is for convenience only and shall
not have any impact on the interpretation of particular provisions. In
the event that any part of these Terms is held to be invalid or
unenforceable, the unenforceable part shall be given effect to the
greatest extent possible and the remaining parts will remain in full
force and effect.<br>  22. Contact Information. The Service is offered
