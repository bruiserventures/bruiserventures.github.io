<p>Last Updated: April 24, 2015</p>

<p>Welcome, and thank you for your interest in Bruiser Ventures, LLC. (“BV”,
“we,” or “us”) and our Web site at www.bruiser-ventures.com (the “Site”). This
Privacy Policy applies to this Site and all other websites owned and
operated by BV. BV values the privacy of all individuals who visit
and use the Site (individually, “User” and collectively, “Users”) and
makes it a priority to protect any personally identifiable information
that it obtains from its Users. This Privacy Policy describes BV’s
policies regarding what personally identifiable information BV
gathers from its Users, how BV uses that information, and what BV
does to protect that information. This Privacy Policy is incorporated
by reference in the BV Terms of Service, and capitalized terms not
defined herein are defined in the BV Terms of Service.</p>

<p>By using the Site (whether or not you register for an account for
the Site), you expressly consent to the information handling practices
described in this policy. If you do not want the personally
identifiable information provided to BV to be used in the manner set
forth in this Privacy Policy, please do not use the Site or any
services provided through it.</p>

<p><b>The Information BV Collects:</b></p>
<ul>
<ul>
<li>User-provided Information: When you register for an account for
the Service or at any later time, you may provide to BV what is
generally known as “personally identifiable information” (such as your
name, password, and email address). Since BV uses third party
authentication services (each, an “Authentication Service”) for
account registration and credentialing purposes, you may also be
required to provide your Google ID, Github ID, or your username/ID for
an Authentication Service accepted by BV. The Authentication Service
may also ask you for your password for your account with that
Authentication Service, in which case any password you provide will
not be collected or stored by BV. If you choose to provide any of
the foregoing information, during registration or otherwise, you are
giving BV the permission to use and store it consistent with this
policy.</li>
<li>“Cookies” Information: When you visit the Site, whether or not you
register for an account, BV may send one or more cookies – small
text files containing a string of alphanumeric characters – to your
computer. Cookies remember information about your activities on a
website. BV may use both session cookies and persistent cookies. A
session cookie disappears after you close your browser. A persistent
cookie remains after you close your browser and may be used by your
browser on subsequent visits to the Site. Persistent cookies can be
removed. Please review your web browser “Help” file to learn the
proper way to modify your cookie settings. However, without cookies
you may not have access to certain services or features available on
Service. Third party authentication services used in connection with
Service may also contain cookies set by that third party. BV does
not control these cookies and you should check the privacy policy of
that third party to see whether and how it uses cookies.</li>
<li>“Automatically Collected” Information: When you access or use the
Site or any other part of Service, BV’s servers may automatically
record certain information from your browser by using different types
of technology, including standard log files, “clear gifs” or “web
beacons.” These “server logs” may include your Internet Protocol (IP)
address, browser type, operating system type, internet service
provider (ISP), referring or exit pages, click stream data, operating
system and the dates and times that you visit the Site. Additionally,
BV may record certain information regarding your use of the
Services, such as information regarding the services or features you
have used, the duration for which you used those services or features,
etc.</li>
<li>Third party analytics services: BV may use third party analytics
services, such as Google Analytics, which may collect certain types of
information in connection with your use of the Service. However, these
third party analytics services do not provide BV with any personally
identifiable information about you.</li>
<li>Your communications: When you send email or other communications
to BV, BV may retain that email or other communications and
collect information associated with that email or other communications
such as the content, date and time of these messages.</li>
<li>Information from Other Sources: BV may also obtain information,
including personally identifiable information, from third parties and
sources other than Service. If BV combines or associates information
from other sources with personally identifiable information that it
collects through Service, it will treat the combined information as
personally identifiable information in accordance with this Privacy
Policy.</li>
</ul>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>The Way BV Uses Information:</b></p>
<ul>
<ul>
<li>BV generally uses the information you provide or that we collect
to operate, maintain, enhance, and provide all of the features and
services found on or through the Site. BV may use information that
you provide or that it collects from Users to understand and analyze
the usage trends and preferences of our Users, to improve the way the
Service works and looks, and to create new features and
functionality.</li>
<li>BV may use “cookies” information to: (a) remember your
information so that you will not have to re-enter it during your visit
or the next time you visit the Site; and (b) monitor aggregate site
usage metrics such as total number of visitors and pages viewed,
information about users interested in a program, feature, or function,
etc.</li>
<li>BV’s employees, agents and contractors must have a legitimate
business reason to obtain access to the personally identifiable
information you may provide or that BV collects. BV may share your
personally identifiable information with companies that provide
services to it, including outside contractors or agents who help
manage its information activities, but they may only use your
personally identifiable information to provide BV with a specific
service and not for any other purpose.</li>
</ul>
</ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><b>When BV Discloses Information:</b></p>
<ul>
<li>BV may disclose automatically collected and other aggregate
non-personally identifiable information to its affiliates or third
parties in order to assist these parties in understanding the usage,
viewing, and demographic patterns for certain programs, content,
services, features, or functionality available on or through the
Site.</li>
<li>In order to provide you with certain features of the Service, BV
may share aggregate non-personally identifiable information with third
parties providers of services such as Google Analytics, Google Mail,
Google Docs, Amazon Web Services, and Github.</li>
<li>BV may, now or in the future, enable you to share your User
Content with other Users or to post your comments on certain parts of
the Site. If you share your User Content or comments with other Users
in this manner, any personally identifiable information that you
choose to include in, or that is associated with, those comments will
be accessible by the other Users. Once you make your personally
identifiable information available to others in any of these ways, it
may be collected and used by the recipients without
restriction. Therefore, BV strongly recommends that you think
carefully about what you post to or through the Site.</li>
<li>BV may also disclose your personally identifiable information if
required to do so by law or in the good-faith belief that such action
is necessary to comply with state and federal laws (such as
U.S. Copyright law) or respond to a court order, judicial or other
government subpoena, or warrant. In some cases, BV may make these
disclosures without first providing notice to you.</li>
<li>BV also reserves the right to disclose User information that it
believes, in good faith, is appropriate or necessary to take
precautions against liability; to protect BV from fraudulent,
abusive, or unlawful uses; to investigate and defend itself against
any third-party claims or allegations; to assist government
enforcement agencies; to protect the security or integrity of the
Site; or to protect the rights, property, or personal safety of BV,
its Users, or others.</li>
<li>In the event that BV is acquired by or merged with a third-party
entity, it reserves the right, in any of these circumstances, to
transfer or assign the information that it has collected from its
Users as part of that merger, acquisition, sale, or other change of
control.</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Your Choices:</b></p>

<p>You may, of course, decline to share your personally identifiable
information with BV, in which case BV will not be able to provide
to you some of the features and functionality found on or through the
Site. BV may retain all information you submit for a variety of
purposes, including backups and archiving, prevention of fraud and
abuse, and analytics. However, please note that BV will not use or
transfer your personally identifiable information in ways unrelated to
the ones described above without also providing you with an
opportunity to opt out of these unrelated uses.</p>

<p><b>Links to Other Sites:</b></p>

<p>The Site may be linked to internet websites or online services
operated by BV’s affiliates or other third parties. Any information
that you provide to or is automatically collected by these third-party
websites or services is subject to the respective privacy policies of
these third parties. BV’s Privacy Policy does not apply to, and BV
cannot control the activities of, these other third party websites or
services. Please be aware that BV does not warn you when you have
chosen to link through to another website or service from the
Site.</p>

<p><b>Children:</b></p>

<p>BV does not knowingly collect or maintain personally identifiable
information on the Site from persons under 13 years-of-age. If BV
learns that personally identifiable information of persons less than
13-years-of-age has been collected through the Site, then BV will
take the appropriate steps to delete this information.</p>

<p><b>Our Commitment to Data Security:</b></p>

<p>We use certain physical, managerial, and technical safeguards and
systems to preserve the integrity and security of your personal
information. We periodically audit these safeguards and systems to
ensure that they work as intended and that we are able to respond
quickly to a security breach. We cannot, however, ensure or warrant
the security of any information you transmit to BV, and you do so at
your own risk. We cannot guarantee that your information may not be
accessed, disclosed, altered, or destroyed by breach of any physical,
technical, or managerial safeguards.</p>

<p>If we learn of a security systems breach, then we may attempt to
notify you electronically so that you can take appropriate protective
steps. We may post a notice on the Site if a security breach
occurs. Depending on where you live, you may have a legal right to
receive notice of a security breach in writing.</p>

<p><b>International Visitors:</b></p>

<p>The Site may be accessed and/or used by Users located outside the
United. If you choose to use the Site from the European Union or other
regions of the world with laws governing data collection and use that
may differ from U.S. law, then please note that you are transferring
your personally identifiable information outside of those regions to
the United States and by providing your personally identifiable
information on or through the Site you consent to that transfer.<br>
Changes and Updates to this Privacy Policy:<br> This Privacy Policy
may be revised periodically without further notice to you and this
will be reflected by a “last updated” date above. Please revisit this
page to stay aware of any changes. Your continued use of the Site
constitutes your agreement to this Privacy Policy and any future
revisions.</p>

Policy, your personal information, our third-party disclosure
